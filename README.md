## Part 1 Imaging Technique Inspiration

**Audio-based imaging techniques** turn audio data, such as frequency and amplitude, into dynamic, visually stunning animations.

For example, **Doodooc** is a Spotify visualizer. This is a platform which reflects the beat and rhythm of the track through an interactive experience where sound and motion come together in perfect sync. This is the approach in which I'm interested because it enhances sensory engagement through audio-reactive animations that pulse, rotate, or shift color to reflect energy. This approach not only turns designs interactive but gives animations as much variety as the music itself, while creating a personalized and deeply immersive experience.

## Part 2 Coding Technique Exploration

**Web Audio API** is a coding practice to attach to in JavaScript for an audio visualizer project. It enables dynamic processing and analysis of audio data, allowing the creation of visuals that synchronize with sound. Using the `AnalyserNode` in Web Audio API allows for retrieving frequency and waveform data, which can be plotted in real time onto an HTML5 canvas by using the **Canvas API**. `requestAnimationFrame` ensures smooth continuous rendering. A combination of all these APIs efficiently creates responsive and fascinating audio-visual experiences, making a deeper connection between the sound and its visual representation.
